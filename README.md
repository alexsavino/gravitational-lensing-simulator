Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex Savino, a recent Astrophysics graduate from Columbia University.

This repository houses a personal project I developed during my sophomore year of college: an educational, interactive gravitational lensing simulator built with Pythonâ€™s graphics package, Turtle.

In this simulation, users can adjust specific parameters to visualize and intuitively understand gravitational lensingâ€”a phenomenon rarely observed live and in controlled environments. The simulation features two objects: a foreground black hole (solid blue) and a background star (unfilled orange). The star's light is bent by the black hole, and this deflection is visualized as the star moves horizontally across the sky at a constant speed. The yellow specks represent the deflected light rays observed from the perspective of the user during the starâ€™s transit.

I embarked on this project to challenge myself, as I initially knew nothing about gravitational lensing, the Turtle package, or Python coding at the time. Despite this, I successfully constructed a simple lensing scenario to help users better understand this fascinating process.

Below is an example run of the simulation. (Note: The GIF does not include the cool geodesics drawn in the full simulation when downloaded.)

For a comprehensive description of my motivation, the project's structure, the coding logic, and the relevant mathematics, check out my full paper:

(Another NOTE: I revisited and edited this project a year later, so the example run you see above may differ slightly from the graphics in the paper.) 

Looking back, there's much more that can be done to improve or build upon this project. If you're interested, please reach out, fork the project, and submit a pull request. Excited to work together!! :)
